In HW6, I build communication between PIC32 and LCD via SPI, and display "hello world", a loading bar including number reading from 0 to 100, my name, and a live FPS reading on LCD screen. Files include circuit diagram drawing, circuit board picture, a demo video, and a coding folder called "HW6.X".

With help of ME433 Wiki hints that are based on core functions about drawing string, character and loading bar on LCD, I create algorithm called main.c in "HW6.X". Also, ST7735.c and ST7735.h are the instructions and library of the LCD communication.
